Balancing Robot Project 

I am pleased to share my experience in developing and implementing the Balancing Robot project, which is a practical application of principles in artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering. This robot was designed to stand independently and maintain balance when subjected to disturbances.

Project Details:
1. **MPU6050 Gyroscope**: The MPU6050 gyroscope was used to measure the acceleration and angle of the robot, helping to determine its tilt and maintain balance.
2. **Arduino Uno**: The Arduino Uno board was used as the main control unit, executing the necessary program to control the robot and adjust its balance.
3. **Dual DC Motors and Encoders**: DC motors were used to move the robot, while encoders were employed to measure the rotation speed and adjust motion accurately.
4. **Simulink/MATLAB**: Simulink/MATLAB software was used to design the control model based on the PID Control algorithm, aiding in determining the required balance rate and executing it precisely.
5. **PID Control**: PID control was used to regulate the speed and maintain dynamic balance of the robot using data from the gyroscope and encoders.
